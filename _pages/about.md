I am Chirag Modi, currently working as a Data Scientist at Turing, where I design agentic workflows using the Plan-and-Execute and ReAct frameworks to fine-tune frontier LLMs for enterprise automation, focusing on solutions for ServiceNow.

I completed my M.Tech in Computer Science (2025) from IIT Gandhinagar. My thesis, supervised by Prof. Sameer G. Kulkarni, focused on high-performance networking in Linux systems. I explored DPDK-based solutions to accelerate packet processing, evaluating various user-space TCP/IP stacks to identify optimal performance characteristics. I also developed a DNS resolver using DPDK, which is currently being extended to containerized environments with AF_XDP and Multus CNI plugins.

During my master’s, I worked as a Founding Engineer at Kapidhwaj.ai, based in the IIT Gandhinagar Research Park. We developed a surveillance IP camera solution to detect unusual or criminal activity and send real-time alerts to authorities. My contributions included building a scalable, low-latency cloud-based streaming solution for local IP camera feeds, implementing a WebRTC pipeline for real-time delivery to end users, and creating a Node.js application for Raspberry Pi to manage cameras within the local network.

Before my master’s, I worked as a Software Engineer at WiseDV Inc., contributing to Bozu, a WebRTC-based video conferencing platform. I developed features for the desktop application, such as closed captions, meeting recordings, and desktop notifications, using the Electron framework. I also led the horizontal scaling of media and signal servers by transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices, designing AWS auto-scaling policies, and deploying scaled infrastructure using EC2, CloudWatch, VPC, RDS, Route 53, ELB, and NLB.

I have strong problem-solving skills and a passion for competitive programming, with a maximum LeetCode rating of 1675 and over 750 problems solved.[LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/chiragmodi2207/)
