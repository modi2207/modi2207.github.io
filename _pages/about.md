I am currently pursuing an M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, where I am working on my thesis in computer systems under the guidance of Prof. Sameer Kulkarni. Before M.Tech, I spent two years as a software engineer at WiseDV (2021-2023), where I delved into a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as AWS, MEAN stack, WebRTC, and Electron.

I completed my B.Tech from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 2021. I have qualified the GATE exam three times, with my best rank being AIR 543 in 2023. Additionally, I have passed the written tests for ISRO and BARC and was shortlisted for interviews for scientist roles.

My enthusiasm lies in exploring new advancements in computer systems, including operating systems, computer networks, and architecture. I have also ventured into machine learning, data science, and natural language processing.

I love to do competative coding. I have max rating 1675 on leetcode with more than 500 problem solved. Here is my profile [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/chiragmodi2207/)
